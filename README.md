# FindWater
Welcome to an exciting adventure where survival is the key to success! In this game, you will find yourself on a small map where your goal is to find scattered water bottles. But keep in mind that the map is not without obstacles - cacti that can sting you and various power-ups that can help or hurt you. You must be strategic in your approach as you move around the map in search of water to stay alive. Keep a close eye on the water meter, because if it drops below zero, your health will begin to deteriorate. The stakes are high as the game ends when your health is reduced to zero. Are you ready to take on the challenge? Can you survive the treacherous terrain and emerge as the ultimate survivor?
